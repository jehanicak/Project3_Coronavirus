## Project 3 
### Jake Hanicak -  4/30/20 - Interaction Design

#### I have created a interactive Coronavirus survival guide parody.

###### This will include 7 different states that you can access with they keys '1-7'

###### This interactive cite will also be working along with my esp32. I will do this by building interactions into it with my LDR and a button.
