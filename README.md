#### Link - https://youtu.be/UzdNvTsqta8 !! also as a note my files are latge vector pngs and processing has a hard tiem handeling them - to run the program without a memory error go to your settings and then check the box for "increase maximum memory" and then set it to 3500 mb. Then it will work as it is intended to!

#### I have created a interactive Coronavirus survival guide parody.

###### This will include 7 different states that you can access with they keys '1-67'

###### This interactive cite will also be working along with my esp32. I will do this by building interactions into it with my LDR and a button. 

###### I have also used and modified code from in class examples to help my project be more sucessful!
