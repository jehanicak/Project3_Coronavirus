## Project 3 
### Jake Hanicak -  4/30/20 - Interaction Design

#### Link - https://youtu.be/UzdNvTsqta8 !! also as a note my files are latge vector pngs and processing has a hard tiem handeling them - to run the program without a memory error go to your settings and then check the box for "increase maximum memory" and then set it to 3500 mb. Then it will work as it is intended to!

#### I have created a interactive Coronavirus survival guide parody.

###### This will include 6 different states that you can access with they keys '1-6'

###### Here is what can be done in each state:
State 1 - the opening page (gives basic instruction)
State 2 - the maskers - Press the button and cover the LDR 
State 3 - the distancers - hover over the ldr to see another person, also shine a light on the LDR to see another person
State 4 - the Bubblers - Press the button
State 5 - The Leavers - cover the LDR to maek the people leave earth slower, but shine a light to make them move faster
State 6 - Ending page (informs user how to get back to the starting page)

###### This interactive site works along with my esp32. I achieved this by building interactions into it with my LDR and a button that communicate with processing. 

###### I have also used and modified code from in class examples to help my project be more sucessful!
